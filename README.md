## Contributors
The group working on this project is composed of:
- [Alain Tiri](https://github.com/AlainTiri)
- [Julien Alardot](https://github.com/JulienAlardot)
- [Jean-Fran√ßois Sengier](https://github.com/JFSengier)

Most of the work was done by Alain and Julien.
We split up the sites to scraps as following : 


| Site              |                         |
| ----------------- |:----------------------- |
| Immoweb           | Alain                   |
| LogicImmo         | Julien                  |
| Vlan              | Jeff                    |

Julien and Alain were racing all day and night toward the record of 50 000
